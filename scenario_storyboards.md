3. **AI Solution in Action:** The AI assistant automatically answers the call. Users can listen to a brief audio snippet of the AI professionally greeting the caller and gathering their information about tooth pain and need for emergency appointment.

4. **Result Visualization:** A notification appears showing "New Patient Lead Captured" with patient details and reason for call (tooth pain, seeking emergency appointment).

5. **Micro-Interaction:** Users can click a "What happens next?" button to advance the flow.

### Scene 2: Instant SMS Follow-up

1. **Transition:** The interface transitions to show a text messaging screen, demonstrating how the system automatically initiates follow-up.

2. **AI in Action:** Users see the AI sending a personalized text message to the patient confirming the emergency appointment for the next day.

3. **Patient Response:** After a brief delay, a simulated response appears confirming and asking about intake forms.

4. **AI Intelligence:** The AI responds with a link to intake forms and confirms the appointment is set.

5. **Value Proposition Highlight:** A subtle overlay appears: "While your competitors send patients to voicemail, your practice converts them to appointmentsâ€”even at 8:45 PM on a Saturday."

6. **ROI Callout:** "Emergency appointments average $1,250 in immediate revenue and $5,400 in lifetime value"

## Scenario Selection Screen

The scenario selection screen will remain largely the same, but with updated descriptions to better reflect the distinct value proposition of each scenario:

1. **After-Hours Emergency Call:**
   "See how AI handles urgent patient calls when your office is closed, ensuring no emergency goes unaddressed and no opportunity is missed."

2. **Busy Front Desk Missing Calls:**
   "Your team is helping patients in-office while calls pile up. See how AI ensures every caller receives immediate attention without putting anyone on hold."

3. **Patient Follow-up & Reactivation:**
   "Patients who miss appointments or need follow-up often fall through the cracks. See how automated sequences keep them engaged and on track with their treatment plans."

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. Each scenario will follow the same three-scene structure but with unique content and visuals.

2. All scenarios will share the same analytics dashboard structure in Scene 3, but with metrics and visualizations specific to the scenario's focus.

3. The scenario selection screen will allow users to switch between scenarios at any point in the demo.

4. Each scenario will have its own set of state variables to track progress and animations.

5. When implementing, we'll ensure that switching scenarios properly resets all state variables and animations.
