### 2. First-Scene Optimization (High Impact / Medium Effort)

**Current State:**  
Demo opens with after-hours call scenario showing incoming call animation

**Test Variations:**
- Variation A: Start with ringing phone + "87% of missed calls go to competitors" stat overlay
- Variation B: Split screen showing "With AI" vs "Without AI" call handling
- Variation C: Video testimonial intro from practice owner about missed calls impact

**Expected Impact:**  
15-25% increase in demo completion rate

**Implementation Effort:**  
Medium - Requires new content creation and scene restructuring

- Variation B: Industry-specific presets (dental, dermatology, etc.) with relevant metrics
- Variation C: Comparative ROI showing 1-month, 6-month, and 5-year projections

**Expected Impact:**  
25-40% increase in call booking conversion rate

**Implementation Effort:**  
High - Requires new UI components and calculation logic

**Measurement Plan:**  
Track engagement with calculator and subsequent booking rate

**Why This Matters:**  
Personalized ROI calculations create stronger buying motivation by making the value proposition concrete and specific to the prospect's practice.

### 4. Micro-Interaction Enhancements (Medium Impact / Low Effort)

**Current State:**  
Basic transitions between scenes with simple animations

**Test Variations:**

- Variation B: Progressive profiling that adapts content based on user behavior
- Variation C: Retargeting enhancement that shows different scenarios on return visits

**Expected Impact:**  
30-50% increase in conversion rate for targeted segments

**Implementation Effort:**  
High - Requires user data collection, storage, and conditional content

**Measurement Plan:**  
Track conversion rates by segment and personalization path

**Why This Matters:**  
Personalized experiences dramatically increase relevance and conversion rates, though they require more complex implementation.
