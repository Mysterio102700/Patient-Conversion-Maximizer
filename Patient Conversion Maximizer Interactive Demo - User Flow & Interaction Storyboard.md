## User Journey & Interaction Flow

### Entry Point: Widget Trigger
The journey begins with a subtle but attention-grabbing widget that appears on the landing page. The widget features a pulsing phone icon with a missed call notification badge, paired with copy that addresses the primary pain point: "See how AI handles your missed calls 24/7."

When users click this trigger, the demo expands into a modal experience that simulates a medical practice's communication system, with the following interaction flow:

### Scene 1: After-Hours Call Scenario

1. **Initial State:** The demo opens showing a simulated smartphone interface with the current time displayed as after-hours (8:45 PM). A calendar widget shows it's a weekend.

2. **Dramatization:** An incoming call animation plays, showing "Potential Patient - Jane Smith" calling. After three rings, a message appears: "Your front desk is closed. Without AI assistance, this call would go to voicemail."

3. **AI Solution in Action:** The AI assistant automatically answers the call. Users can listen to a brief audio snippet of the AI professionally greeting the caller and gathering their information.

4. **Result Visualization:** A notification appears showing "New Patient Lead Captured" with patient details and reason for call (tooth pain, seeking emergency appointment).

5. **Micro-Interaction:** Users can click a "What happens next?" button to advance the flow.

### Scene 2: Instant SMS Follow-up

1. **Transition:** The interface transitions to show a text messaging screen, demonstrating how the system automatically initiates follow-up.

2. **AI in Action:** Users see the AI sending a personalized text message to the patient: "Hi Jane, thanks for calling Smith Dental. We've reserved a priority appointment for you tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Reply YES to confirm or suggest another time."

3. **Patient Response:** After a brief delay, a simulated response appears: "YES, thank you! Can I fill out forms ahead of time?"

4. **AI Intelligence:** The AI responds with a link to intake forms and confirms the appointment is set.

5. **Value Proposition Highlight:** A subtle overlay appears: "Never miss another patient inquiry, even after hours. Convert calls to appointments automatically."

6. **Micro-Interaction:** Users can click "View Practice Dashboard" to continue.

### Scene 3: HIPAA-Compliant Analytics Dashboard

1. **Transition:** The interface transitions to a simplified analytics dashboard showing key metrics.

2. **Data Visualization:** Users see a weekly summary of:
   - Calls handled (with percentage increase)
   - Average response time (comparing manual vs. AI)
   - Conversion rate from inquiry to appointment
   - Breakdown of call times showing after-hours volume

3. **ROI Highlight:** A calculation shows estimated revenue impact based on additional converted patients.

4. **HIPAA Compliance:** A badge prominently displays "HIPAA Compliant" with tooltip explaining security measures.

5. **Final CTA:** A prominent "Book a Demo Call" button appears with copy: "See how Patient Conversion Maximizer can work with your practice's unique needs."

### Exit Points & Alternative Flows

1. **Quick Exit:** At any point, users can click "X" to close the demo and return to the landing page.

2. **Restart Demo:** Users can click "Try Another Scenario" to explore different pain points:
   - Scenario A: After-hours emergency call (default)
   - Scenario B: Busy front desk missing calls during office hours
   - Scenario C: Patient follow-up for appointment confirmation

3. **Direct to Calendly:** From any scene, users can access the "Book a Call" button to schedule a personalized demo.

## Technical Interaction Notes

1. **Progressive Loading:** Each scene loads progressively to maintain performance, with lightweight animations.

2. **Audio Control:** Voice interactions include mute controls and text transcripts for accessibility.

3. **Responsive Behavior:** On mobile devices, the demo adapts to full-screen mode with simplified interactions.

4. **Performance Optimization:** Simulated delays mimic real-world timing without affecting demo responsiveness.

5. **Data Simulation:** All patient data is fictional and clearly labeled as "Demo Data" for compliance.
